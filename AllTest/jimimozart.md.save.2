Jimi Hendrix was born Johnny Allen Hendrix in 1942 Seattle, Washington. The son of a 17 year old woman and an alcoholic father, Jimi's upbringing was harsh at times. He often lived with relatives and sometimes acquaintences when his parents werent getting along.  At 15 years old Jimi Hendrix's life would change forever when he was given his first guitar.  He quickly grew fond of the instrument but unfortunately his 15th year of life was marked by the tragic death of his mother.  While Jimi had lost his Mother he gained a guitar that would prove to be his most cherished possession. Jimi Hendrix would go on to become one of the most iconic figures in Rock n' Roll and Blues.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born in Salzberg, Austria in 1756. Born to the son of the famous Composer Leopold Mozart and middle class mother Mozart was fond of instruments from a very early age.  At the age of 6 Mozart began to play publicly and soon was writing symphonies before reaching adulthood.  Mozart would often shake the establishment if any societal norms annoyed him, writing an opera in German, a language deemed not fit for opera, was one of Mozart's many acts that defied society at the time.  Mozart also was known for his wildly eccentric behavior, sending letters to his father of his adult affairs as he travelled around as a young man.  I would say that it was not Jimi Hendrix nor Elvis Presley who started the spirit of Rock n' Roll, but the musical prodigy known as Mozart.

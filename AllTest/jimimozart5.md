# Who's the first rockstar?

Most people confuse Elvis Presley or Jimi Hendrix as the first rockstar who lived.

But we must realize that neither of these musical greats can truely raise the flag for the first rockstar.  Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was truely the first.
For us to make this declaration we must first define what a rockstar truely is, and what it means to rock.

For me a rockstar is one who's sole purpose is to radiate energy for people and give hope while breaking barriers and asking the establishment, why? Always using music as their main instrument of changing the landscape.  These qualities are important for a rockstar, for they are usually the flagship of freedom for the people.
Obviously nowadays we have so many posers who claim to be rockstars but in reality are nothing but schmucks who serve the clothing lines, the machine that is unintelligent and unaware capitalism.  These posers seek to represent a freedom that we are not just cattle for corporations to buy and sell, only to be told of the long list of sponsors and upcoming latest coupon deals.

Mozart was a man who defied the establishment at the time.  Writing pieces such as "Lick me in mein arsch" roughly translated to kiss my ass.  There were many who doubted Mozart's musical ability.
There were many musicians who deemed it impossible to write an Opera in german.  Mozart wrote a german opera in one night on the fly after losing the other opera he wrote originally for the concert due the next day.  He was known to correct other composers in person, trumping their own music in front of them with additions of his own. "Perhaps a c# here and a f here".
His eccentric personality drew friends and enemies alike during his life time.  Many politicians at the time wanted Moazart to come to their 18th century European country to visit, but many feared that his eccentric personality and often times bizarre fascination with perversions and women would lead many citizens in their country to re-think their lifestyle. If this doesn't sound like the first instance of a true rockstar i don't know what does.
